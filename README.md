This project repackages **Hoppscotch** documentation into a Docs-as-Code site using **Docusaurus**.

### Deliverables
- **intro.md** – High-level overview of Hoppscotch
- **getting-started.md** – Step-by-step installation & setup
- **reference/** – Example API endpoint documentation (`GET /collections`, `POST /requests`)

### Summary
Hoppscotch is a modern and lightweight API testing tool, but its docs are spread across the GitHub repository and community resources.  

By restructuring them into:
- A clear **intro**
- A **setup guide**
- An **API reference section**  

I was able to show how a Docs-as-Code approach can make an open-source project more accessible and professional.
