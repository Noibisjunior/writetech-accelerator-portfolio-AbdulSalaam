# Module 1: Documentation Tooling & Static Site Generators

This project demonstrates the application of **Docs-as-Code** principles by repackaging **Hoppscotch** documentation into a professional, structured site using **Docusaurus**.

## Project Overview

Hoppscotch is a modern and lightweight API testing tool, but its documentation is distributed across the GitHub repository and community resources. This project consolidates and restructures that information into a cohesive, easy-to-navigate documentation site.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Introduction (`intro.md`)
Provides a high-level overview of Hoppscotch, explaining what it is, its key features, and why developers choose it for API testing.

### 2. Getting Started (`getting-started.md`)
Offers step-by-step installation and setup instructions, including:
- Prerequisites and system requirements
- Numbered installation steps for clarity
- Configuration and first-time setup guidance

### 3. API Reference (`api-reference/`)
Contains detailed endpoint documentation with practical examples:
- **GET /collections** – Retrieving user collections
- **POST /requests** – Creating new API requests

Each endpoint includes:
- Purpose and use cases
- Request/response examples
- Error handling scenarios
- Best practices

## Documentation Approach

By restructuring the documentation with a Docs-as-Code methodology, this project demonstrates how:

- **Clear structure** improves information discoverability
- **Consistent formatting** enhances readability
- **Code examples** provide practical, actionable guidance
- **Error documentation** helps users troubleshoot effectively

This approach transforms scattered information into a professional, accessible resource that serves both new users and experienced developers.
