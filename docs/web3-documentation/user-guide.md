# Uniswap User Guide: Onboarding, Transactions, and Common Tasks

Welcome to this comprehensive user guide for Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum and other blockchains. Uniswap allows you to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) without relying on traditional intermediaries. 

This guide is structured around the Web3 Documentation Framework to help you get started quickly, understand core concepts, reference technical details, and apply practical examples.

If you're a beginner looking to make your first swap or a developer integrating Uniswap, this guide covers essential onboarding, transactions, and troubleshooting. Always ensure you are using the official Uniswap app (app.uniswap.org) and verify URLs to avoid scams.

## 1. Getting Started 

This section covers the basics to get you up and running with Uniswap fast.

### Prerequisites
Before using Uniswap, ensure you have:
- **A Web3 Wallet**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, or any web 3 wallet. These allow you to interact with the Ethereum network securely.
- **Ethereum or Supported Network Knowledge**: Basic understanding of blockchain concepts like gas fees (transaction costs) and network confirmations.
- **Funds**: Some ETH for gas fees even for swaps on other tokens. For swaps, you'll need the tokens you want to exchange.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox. Enable wallet extensions if needed.
- **Security Awareness**: Never share your seed phrase. Use official sites and double-check contract addresses.


### QuickStart: 
1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Go to [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org). Click "Connect Wallet" and select your provider (e.g., MetaMask). Approve the connection in your wallet.
2. **Select Networks**: Choose Ethereum Mainnet (or Polygon/Arbitrum for lower fees). Ensure your wallet is on the same network.
3. **Make a Simple Swap**:
   - Select tokens (e.g., ETH to USDC) in the swap interface.
   - Enter the amount and review the exchange rate, slippage, and gas fee.
   - Click "Swap" and confirm in your wallet.
4. **Confirm Transaction**: Wait for network confirmation, usually takes seconds to minutes. Check your wallet for the swapped tokens.


### Installation/Setup: Tools, Wallets, Network Configuration
- **Wallet Setup**:
  - Download MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) (browser extension or mobile app).
  - Create a new wallet or import an existing one. Back up your seed phrase securely.
  - Add networks: In MetaMask, go to Settings > Networks > Add Network. For Polygon, use RPC URL `https://polygon-rpc.com` and Chain ID 137.
- **Browser and Extensions**: Ensure your browser supports Web3 (e.g., install the MetaMask extension). Test by visiting a dApp like Uniswap.
- **Mobile Access**: Use the Uniswap mobile app or wallet apps for on-the-go access.
- **Troubleshooting Setup**: If wallet connection fails, check network mismatches or clear browser cache. For gas issues, switch to Layer 2 networks like Polygon.

### First Interaction
Let's swap 0.1 ETH for DAI (a stablecoin):
1. Connect wallet and ensure you have ETH.
2. In Uniswap, select ETH as input and DAI as output.
3. Enter 0.1 in the input field—Uniswap auto-calculates DAI output.
4. Set slippage tolerance to 0.5% (adjust for volatile tokens).
5. Click "Swap" > Confirm in wallet > Wait for confirmation.
Expected: ~$180–200 DAI (based on current rates). use the transaction hash to check the transaction details on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).


## 2. How It Works 


### High-Level Overview
Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that uses smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer token swaps. Unlike centralized exchanges, it relies on liquidity providers, users like you who add tokens to pools. 

When you swap, you are trading against these pools, with prices determined by a mathematical formula (x * y = k). No order books, just direct, permissionless trading. Value flows through fees (0.3% per swap, shared with liquidity providers) and governance tokens (UNI) for community decisions.

### Core Concepts
- **Liquidity Pools**: Reserves of two tokens (e.g., ETH/DAI) that enable swaps. Adding liquidity earns you pool tokens (LP tokens) and a share of fees.
- **Slippage**: Price impact from large trades. Set tolerance (e.g., 0.5%) to avoid bad rates.
- **Gas Fees**: Ethereum network costs. Higher during congestion, use Layer 2 for savings.
- **Impermanent Loss**: Potential loss for liquidity providers if token prices diverge vs. holding tokens separately.
- **Flash Swaps**: Advanced feature for arbitrage without upfront capital for developers.

### Real Scenarios and Use Cases
- **Newbie Swapper**: Alice wants to convert ETH to stablecoins. She follows the QuickStart, swaps easily, and avoids high fees by timing off-peak hours.
- **Liquidity Provider**: Bob adds ETH and USDC to a pool, earning 0.3% fees on swaps. He monitors for impermanent loss and withdraws when needed.
- **DeFi Explorer**: Carol uses Uniswap to access new tokens, then stakes them elsewhere for yield.
- **Developer**: Dave integrates Uniswap's SDK for a dApp, querying prices and executing swaps programmatically.

### Architecture Overview
- **Smart Contracts**: Core logic on Ethereum (V2/V3 routers, factories, pairs).
- **Frontend**: Web app (React-based) for user interaction.
- **Oracles and Integrations**: Price feeds from Chainlink; compatible with wallets like MetaMask.
- **Governance**: UNI token holders vote on protocol changes via snapshots.

### Economic Models: How Value Flows
- **Swaps**: 0.3% fee split: 0.25% to liquidity providers, 0.05% to UNI stakers.
- **Liquidity Mining**: Incentives for providing liquidity in new pools.
- **UNI Token**: Used for governance and rewards. Value derived from protocol usage and adoption.

## 3. Smart Contract References 

For developers, here's a key information on Uniswap's contracts. Always verify addresses on [docs.uniswap.org](https://docs.uniswap.org).

### Contract Addresses
- **Uniswap V3 Router**: `0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564` (Ethereum Mainnet)
- **Factory**: `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`
- **Common Pairs**: ETH/USDC pool at `0x8ad599c3A0ff1De082011EFDDc58f1908eb6e6D8`
- **Multi-Chain**: Similar addresses on Polygon, Arbitrum,check per network.

### Function Reference: All Public Functions with Parameters
- **Swap Functions** (in Router):
  - `exactInputSingle(params)`: Swap exact input amount for output.
    - Params: tokenIn, tokenOut, fee, recipient, deadline, amountIn, amountOutMinimum, sqrtPriceLimitX96.
  - `exactOutputSingle(params)`: Swap for exact output amount.
- **Liquidity Functions** (in NonfungiblePositionManager):
  - `mint(params)`: Add liquidity to a position.
    - Params: token0, token1, fee, tickLower, tickUpper, amount0Desired, amount1Desired, amount0Min, amount1Min, recipient, deadline.
  - `burn(positionId)`: Remove liquidity.
- **Query Functions**:
  - `quoteExactInputSingle(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn)`: Estimate output for input.
  - `quoteExactOutputSingle(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountOut)`: Estimate input for output.

### Events and Logs: What Events Are Emitted and When
- **Swap Event**: Emitted on every swap with amount0In, amount1In, amount0Out, amount1Out, sender, to.
- **Mint Event**: When liquidity is added, logs owner, tickLower, tickUpper, amount, amount0, amount1.
- **Burn Event**: On liquidity removal, similar to Mint.
- **Transfer Event**: For ERC-20 pool tokens.

### Error Conditions: All Possible Revert Reasons
- **Insufficient Liquidity**: If pool can't fulfill swap, then you need to increase slippage tolerance.
- **Deadline Exceeded**: Transaction too slow, then increase deadline.
- **Amount Too Low/High**: Output/input doesn't meet minimums, then adjust parameters.
- **Invalid Token**: Unsupported or malicious tokens, use verified lists.
- **Gas Estimation Failures**: Network congestion, retry with higher gas fees.

### Deployment Information: Constructor Parameters, Deployment Process
- **V3 Core**: Deployed via factory pattern. Key params: factory address, WETH9 (wrapped ETH).
- **Process**: Uniswap governance proposes upgrades; community votes. New pools auto-deploy via factory.
- **Verification**: All contracts are open-source and verified on Etherscan.

## 4. Example Interactions

Hands-on examples for common tasks.

### Code Examples: Multiple Programming Languages
- **JavaScript (with Ethers.js)**:
  ```javascript
  const { ethers } = require('ethers');
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  const signer = provider.getSigner();
  const routerAddress = '0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564';
  const routerABI = [/* Uniswap V3 Router ABI */];
  const router = new ethers.Contract(routerAddress, routerABI, signer);
  // Swap ETH for DAI
  const tx = await router.exactInputSingle({
    tokenIn: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH
    tokenOut: '0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F', // DAI
    fee: 3000, // 0.3% fee tier
    recipient: signer.getAddress(),
    deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60,
    amountIn: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1'),
    amountOutMinimum: 0,
    sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
  });
  console.log('Swap TX:', tx.hash);
  ```
- **Python (with Web3.py)**:
  ```python
  from web3 import Web3
  w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY'))
  router_address = '0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564'
  # Similar ABI and params as JS
  tx = contract.functions.exactInputSingle(params).buildTransaction({'gas': 200000})
  signed_tx = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(tx, private_key='YOUR_KEY')
  tx_hash = w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_tx.rawTransaction)
  print('TX Hash:', tx_hash.hex())
  ```

### Transaction Examples: Actual On-Chain Transaction Breakdowns
- **Simple Swap**: [Example TX on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x123...abc) – 0.1 ETH to USDC. Gas: 150,000; Fee: $5–10.
- **Liquidity Addition**: [Example TX](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x456...def) – Mint LP tokens. Includes tick range and amounts.
- **Breakdown**: Input params → Smart contract execution → Events (Swap/Mint) → Confirmation.

### Integration Patterns: Common Ways to Use the Protocol
- **dApp Integration**: Embed Uniswap Widget for seamless swaps in your app.
- **Arbitrage Bots**: Monitor prices across pools and swap for profit.
- **Yield Farming**: Provide liquidity, then stake LP tokens on platforms like Yearn.
- **Multi-Chain**: Use bridges like the Polygon Bridge for cross-chain swaps.

### Troubleshooting: Common Issues and Solutions
- **High Slippage**: Increase tolerance or split large swaps.
- **Failed Transactions**: Check gas price, use EthGasStation or network congestion.
- **Stuck Transactions**: Speed up in wallet or cancel/replace.
- **Wallet Errors**: Ensure correct network and sufficient funds.
- **Scam Prevention**: Verify contract addresses and use official links.

### Testing Strategies: How to Test Integrations Safely
- **Testnets**: Use Goerli or Sepolia for Ethereum testing. Get free ETH from faucets.
- **Forked Mainnet**: Tools like Hardhat simulate real conditions without real funds.
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Uniswap contracts in code to test swaps/liquidity.
- **Gas Estimation**: Always estimate before sending to avoid failures.
- **Static Analysis**: For custom integrations, use static analysis tools for security vulnerabilities.
