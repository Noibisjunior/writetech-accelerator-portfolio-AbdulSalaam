# Web3 Documentation Project

This project is part of the WriteTech Accelerator Programme, it explains technical writing in the Web3 ecosystem. I chose **Option B** and created documentation to improve accessibility and understanding of decentralized tools and APIs.

I selected Option B, User Guide for a Web3 Tool or dApp, focusing on Uniswap. Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap tokens and provide liquidity without intermediaries. 

I chose this because it is a foundational Web3 tool with real-world utility, and creating a user guide helps bridge the gap for beginners navigating DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols. This guide emphasizes onboarding, transactions, and common tasks to make Uniswap more accessible.

## Files Included

| File            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| user-guide.md   | Comprehensive end-user guide for Uniswap, covering onboarding, key concepts, smart contract references, and practical examples based on the Web3 Documentation Framework. |

## What I Learned
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of Web3 ecosystems, particularly DeFi protocols like Uniswap. I learned how to structure technical documentation in layers (from foundational to practical) to explain each concept to different user needs, and the importance of balancing simplicity for end-users with technical depth for developers.

 
## Challenges
One key challenge was explaining complex topics like automated market makers (AMMs) and gas fees into beginner-friendly language without oversimplifying. I also had to cross-reference Uniswap's evolving documentation to keep the guide up-to-date.
