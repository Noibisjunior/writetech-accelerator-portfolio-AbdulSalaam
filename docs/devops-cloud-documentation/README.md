## Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This documentation is designed to help developers of all skill levels implement robust automation workflows for their projects.

### What is CI/CD?

```
  Code Push          Build & Test         Deploy
      ↓                   ↓                  ↓
  ┌────────┐        ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
  │ GitHub │   →    │  GitHub  │  →   │  Cloud   │
  │  Repo  │        │  Actions │      │ Platform │
  └────────┘        └──────────┘      └──────────┘
      ↓                   ↓                  ↓
   Trigger          Automate Test      Auto Deploy
```

## Quick Start

To get started with GitHub Actions:

1. Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one
2. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository
3. Add a new YAML file (e.g., `main.yml`) with your workflow configuration
4. Commit and push your changes to trigger the workflow

Example minimal workflow:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run tests
      run: echo "Running tests..."
```
