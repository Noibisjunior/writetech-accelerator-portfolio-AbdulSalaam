# GitHub Actions: Automating Your Development Workflow

## What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is the practice of automating code testing and deployment. Instead of manually pushing updates, CI/CD pipelines helps you handle:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: automatically test code whenever you push changes.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: automatically deploy changes once they pass tests that are configured by the developers.

## Why GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that integrates directly with your GitHub repository. It allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline right from GitHub. Key benefits include:

- **Native GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly works with your existing GitHub repositories
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Trigger workflows based on GitHub events like push, pull requests, or issue creation
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Run workflows on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Extensive Marketplace**: Access thousands of pre-built actions in the GitHub Marketplace
- **Free for Public Repositories**: Completely free for public repositories and offers generous free minutes for private repositories

## Real-World Applications

GitHub Actions can be used for various purposes:

1. **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every push or pull request
2. **Package Publishing**: Automate npm, Docker, or other package publishing
3. **Deployment**: Deploy to cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
4. **Code Quality**: Run linters and code formatters
5. **Scheduled Tasks**: Run periodic tasks like database backups

## How It Works

GitHub Actions uses YAML files called workflow files that define your automation. These files are stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Each workflow file contains:

- **Events** that trigger the workflow
- **Jobs** that define what to do when the event occurs
- **Steps** that run commands or actions
- **Runners** that execute the workflow

In the following sections, we'll guide you through setting up your first GitHub Actions workflow, from initial setup to advanced configurations.
