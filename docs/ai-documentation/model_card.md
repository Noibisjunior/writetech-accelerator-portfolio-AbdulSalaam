## Limitations and Risks

### Known Limitations
1. **No Built-in Moderation**: Lacks safety guardrails and content filtering mechanisms
2. **Hallucination Risk**: May generate factually incorrect or misleading information
3. **Bias Propagation**: May reflect biases present in training data
4. **Context Degradation**: Performance may decrease with very long input sequences
5. **Language Bias**: Primarily optimized for English language tasks

### Risk Mitigation Recommendations
- Implement external content filtering and safety measures
- Use human oversight for critical applications
- Regular bias testing and monitoring
- Clear user communication about model limitations
- Appropriate use case selection and boundaries

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Assessment
The model may exhibit biases related to:
- Gender, race, and cultural stereotypes
- Geographic and linguistic preferences
- Professional and educational backgrounds
- Political and ideological viewpoints

### Fairness Measures
- Regular evaluation across diverse demographic groups
- Bias detection and measurement protocols
- Inclusive evaluation dataset development
- Ongoing monitoring and improvement processes

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: 16GB GPU memory for inference
- **Recommended**: 24GB+ GPU memory for optimal performance
- **CPU Alternative**: Possible but significantly slower
- **Storage**: ~14GB for full precision model

### Software Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
- mistral-inference (recommended)

## Usage Guidelines

### Installation
```bash
# Using mistral-inference (recommended)
pip install mistral_inference

# Using Hugging Face Transformers
pip install transformers torch
```

### Basic Usage Example
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the model
chatbot = pipeline(
    "text-generation", 
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"
)

# Generate response
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
]
response = chatbot(messages)
```

### Function Calling Example
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Define function for model to call
def get_weather(location: str, format: str):
    """Get current weather information"""
    pass

# Use with conversation and tools
conversation = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"}]
tools = [get_weather]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    conversation, 
    tools=tools, 
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    return_tensors="pt"
)
```
