# API Documentation Project

This project documents the **Chimoney REST API**, including a Getting Started guide and selected endpoints.

## Live Site
https://writetech-accelerator-portfolio-abd.vercel.app/

## What I Improved
- Created a clear, beginner-friendly **Getting Started** guide  
- Standardized endpoint docs with headers, parameters, responses, and errors  
- Added examples with `curl` requests for easy testing  

## Challenges
- Using the openApi plugin was a challenge  
- Understanding authentication took extra time 
- I had problem fixing the npm run build due to the incompatibility of the openApi plugin

## What I Learnt
- How to structure API docs using **Docs-as-Code** best practices  
- Importance of including error responses and sample requests  
- How OpenAPI specs can help generate interactive docs
