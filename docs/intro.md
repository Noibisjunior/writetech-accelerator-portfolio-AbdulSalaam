# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I have completed technical writing projects across various domains â€” including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 â€” using modern documentation workflows and tools.

##  About Me

I am a passionate technical writer with a knack for transforming complex technical concepts into clear, engaging, and accessible content. My journey into writing began with a fascination for technology and a desire to bridge the gap between developers and users. I believe that good documentation isn't just about explaining how something works, but also about telling a compelling story that empowers and educates the reader.
